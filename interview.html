<p>This page is a combination of questions and answers included in both interviews</p>

<br>
        <span class="w3-tag w3-teal w3-round">Why did you choose IT and Social Anthropology as study fields?</span><br>
        
        I have always had a keen interest in IT from a young age. Simplifying processes and reducing inefficiencies in systems ignited my passion which steered me towards choosing CAT and IT as subjects in school. IT is dynamic and constantly evolving and one needs to keep abreast and adapt. This ability to change and adapt resonates with my personality as an individual, where I too am constantly evolving. Studying BSc IT presents endless opportunities for me to grow, gain insight and expand on my knowledge.<br>
        
        Recently, I discovered that while I am equipping myself with the technical skills, there has been a keen awareness that with technology advancement, the human aspect cannot be overlooked, given the challenges that we have had to navigate in the last two years and the full-scale emergence of the Digital Age. I took up an additional subject, Social Anthropology, to compliment my knowledge on how people interact in different social, cultural, political and physical environments with technology. Digital Anthropology is the study of the relationship between humans and technology in the digital-era.<br>
        
        By complementing IT with Anthropology, I believe I can provide the much-needed human insight in the Technology industry. Someday I hope to provide important approaches for the tech sector to better understand the ethical and political context of peoples work on lives. As a “digital anthropologist” I wish to make the tech industry more representative and understanding of the world in which it (technology) seeks to change. <br>        
        What’s coding and how can it be used to make a difference in people's lives?
        Simply put, Coding creates a set of instructions for computers to follow. It is basically the computer language used to develop apps, websites, and software.  
        What is key is the transformation of ideas, solutions, and instructions into a language that computers can understand.
        
        <br>
        <br>
       
        <span class="w3-tag w3-teal w3-round">Please tell more about the #CodeLikeAGirl program. What's the program about and How did you become involved in it?</span><br>
     
        The jobs of the future will require education and skill development in the areas of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM). Sadly, with only 35% of STEM students in higher education being women, the gender gap hinders progress. Females can bring a unique and valuable dimension to this industry. Vodacom launched the #CodeLikeAGirl initiative in South Africa in 2017 to provide young women with access to digital skills training as a part of their dedication to closing this gap. 2 500 Girls have completed the program since it launched, with participants from South Africa, Mozambique, Tanzania, the DRC, and Lesotho. Vodacom intends to continue this admirable initiative, training 1,500 more young women this year alone, with an intention firmly set on an inclusive digital future.
        
        I participated in and won phase one of the #CodeLikeAGirl program in October 2021. Vodacom subsequently offered to fund my BSc in IT degree. Since then, I have been closely involved with Vodacom as an alumni, being afforded the platform to speak at the Phase 2 #CodeLikeAGirl 2021 iteration and at the #CodeLikeAGirl 2022 press release in July at the Vodacom Headquarters in Midrand. I was honored to be interviewed by Mr. Dejan Kastelic, Vodacom’s Group Chief Technology Officer, as part of the Women's Month initiative this year, as well as being and interviewed by Vodacom for their women’s month campaign called #DiscovHer which featured some of the most inspirational women at Vodacom. Vodacom has been instrumental, not only in my education but in giving a voice to the us as the youth and creating opportunities to network, for which I am eternally grateful.

        <br>
        <span class="w3-tag w3-teal w3-round">What were you guys taught in the programme?</span><br> 
        We were taught the basics of web development including HTML, CSS, JavaScript and web development frameworks such as Bootstrap. The pace was adapted to accommodate all learners, in this way ensuring that we understood and learnt from the experience.<br>
        With the skills equipped in the course, we were required to code our own websites as part of a competition.<br>
        Through the skills taught, we were equipped to create websites as part of the competition.<br>
        
        <br>
        <span class="w3-tag w3-teal w3-round">How do you think the stereotypes in spaces like ICT and STEM can be overcome? </span><br> 
        It is critical that as females we don’t stay in the shadows, we must emerge and make our voices heard. We must speak up when we feel discriminated against or when we see it, we must not condone it. And when we do, we as females need to support each other so we don’t become isolated or victimized for speaking out.
        

        <br>
        <br>
        <span class="w3-tag w3-teal w3-round">You are a big part of Willowmoore High's coding culture. Your record speaks volumes. How do you think STEM can be used to change the current situation in South Africa? </span><br> 
        
        STEM, especially coding, can be very empowering. This is no more a luxury but rather a necessity in the current context of our economy where unemployment is high and given the changing dynamics globally due to technology. Through such skills development, women especially, can become more liberated in the workplace and on a personal level.
        
        Tell me about yourself. Where were you born? Which schools did you attend? What's the one thing people don't know about you?
        I was born in Pietermaritzburg, Kwa-Zulu-Natal but I’ve lived in Benoni my whole life. I attended Pioneer Primary School and thereafter Willowmoore High School. 
        Im an avid reader. Something that most people don’t know about me is that in my spare time I love watching movies and posting reviews on them from a critical perspective in relation to society, norms, beliefs, stereotypes etc.
