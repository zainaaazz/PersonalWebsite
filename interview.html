<p>This page is a combination of questions and answers included in both interviews</p>

<br>


<span class="w3-tag w3-teal w3-round">What are you currently studying, and how did you come to be affiliated with Vodacom?</span><br>
I participated in and won phase one of the CodeLikeAGirl program in October 2021. Vodacom then offered to fund my BSc in IT with Social Anthropology degree. I'm currently 18 and in my first year at the North West University, Potchefstroom campus. I was honoured to be invited as an alumni to speak at the phase 2 CodeLikeAGirl 2021 iteration and at the CodeLikeAGirl 2022 press release which took place in July 2022 at the Vodacom Headquarters in Midrand. I was interviewed by Dejan Kastelic, Vodacom’s Group Chief Technology Officer for Women's Month in 2022 as well.
<br>
<br>


        <span class="w3-tag w3-teal w3-round">Why did you choose IT and Social Anthropology as study fields?</span><br>
        
        I have always had a keen interest in IT from a young age. Simplifying processes and reducing inefficiencies in systems ignited my passion which steered me towards choosing CAT and IT as subjects in school. IT is dynamic and constantly evolving and one needs to keep abreast and adapt. This ability to change and adapt resonates with my personality as an individual, where I too am constantly evolving. Studying BSc IT presents endless opportunities for me to grow, gain insight and expand on my knowledge.<br>
        
        Recently, I discovered that while I am equipping myself with the technical skills, there has been a keen awareness that with technology advancement, the human aspect cannot be overlooked, given the challenges that we have had to navigate in the last two years and the full-scale emergence of the Digital Age. I took up an additional subject, Social Anthropology, to compliment my knowledge on how people interact in different social, cultural, political and physical environments with technology. Digital Anthropology is the study of the relationship between humans and technology in the digital-era.<br>
        
        By complementing IT with Anthropology, I believe I can provide the much-needed human insight in the Technology industry. Someday I hope to provide important approaches for the tech sector to better understand the ethical and political context of peoples work on lives. As a “digital anthropologist” I wish to make the tech industry more representative and understanding of the world in which it (technology) seeks to change. <br>        
        What’s coding and how can it be used to make a difference in people's lives?
        Simply put, Coding creates a set of instructions for computers to follow. It is basically the computer language used to develop apps, websites, and software.  
        What is key is the transformation of ideas, solutions, and instructions into a language that computers can understand.
        
        <br>
        <br>
       
        <span class="w3-tag w3-teal w3-round">Please tell more about the #CodeLikeAGirl program. What's the program about and How did you become involved in it?</span><br>
     
        The jobs of the future will require education and skill development in the areas of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM). Sadly, with only 35% of STEM students in higher education being women, the gender gap hinders progress. Females can bring a unique and valuable dimension to this industry. Vodacom launched the #CodeLikeAGirl initiative in South Africa in 2017 to provide young women with access to digital skills training as a part of their dedication to closing this gap. 2 500 Girls have completed the program since it launched, with participants from South Africa, Mozambique, Tanzania, the DRC, and Lesotho. Vodacom intends to continue this admirable initiative, training 1,500 more young women this year alone, with an intention firmly set on an inclusive digital future.
        
        I participated in and won phase one of the #CodeLikeAGirl program in October 2021. Vodacom subsequently offered to fund my BSc in IT degree. Since then, I have been closely involved with Vodacom as an alumni, being afforded the platform to speak at the Phase 2 #CodeLikeAGirl 2021 iteration and at the #CodeLikeAGirl 2022 press release in July at the Vodacom Headquarters in Midrand. I was honored to be interviewed by Mr. Dejan Kastelic, Vodacom’s Group Chief Technology Officer, as part of the Women's Month initiative this year, as well as being and interviewed by Vodacom for their women’s month campaign called #DiscovHer which featured some of the most inspirational women at Vodacom. Vodacom has been instrumental, not only in my education but in giving a voice to the us as the youth and creating opportunities to network, for which I am eternally grateful.
        
        <br>
        <br>
        <span class="w3-tag w3-teal w3-round">What were you guys taught in the programme?</span><br> 
        We were taught the basics of web development including HTML, CSS, JavaScript and web development frameworks such as Bootstrap. The pace was adapted to accommodate all learners, in this way ensuring that we understood and learnt from the experience.<br>
        With the skills equipped in the course, we were required to code our own websites as part of a competition.<br>
        Through the skills taught, we were equipped to create websites as part of the competition.<br>
        
        <br>
        <span class="w3-tag w3-teal w3-round">How do you think the stereotypes in spaces like ICT and STEM can be overcome? </span><br> 
        It is critical that as females we don’t stay in the shadows, we must emerge and make our voices heard. We must speak up when we feel discriminated against or when we see it, we must not condone it. And when we do, we as females need to support each other so we don’t become isolated or victimized for speaking out.
        

        <br>
        <br>
        <span class="w3-tag w3-teal w3-round">You are a big part of Willowmoore High's coding culture. Your record speaks volumes. How do you think STEM can be used to change the current situation in South Africa? </span><br> 
        
        STEM, especially coding, can be very empowering. This is no more a luxury but rather a necessity in the current context of our economy where unemployment is high and given the changing dynamics globally due to technology. Through such skills development, women especially, can become more liberated in the workplace and on a personal level.
        
        <br>
        <br>
        <span class="w3-tag w3-teal w3-round"> Share one of your biggest achievements – professionally, personally or both?</span><br> 
Professional: In my matric year, I was the first student in 12 years to be awarded with the prestigious “Cum Laude” title, or informally known as the “white blazer”. I was the first person of colour, and the third person in the history of Willowmoore High School to have received this honour. It was through the extreme dedication towards both my extramural activities and academics throughout my high school tenure, which included half colours for academics (2017, 2018), full colours for academics (2019), half colours for cricket (2019), full colours for girl guides (2020), honours for robotics (2020) and honours for extramurals (2020).<br>
<br>
Personal: At the tender age of 16, I obtained a Google Play Developer license and published my first app on the Google Play Store. The app was free to download and consisted of past exam papers for all subjects for grades 8 to 11. From the positive feedback received, I felt a huge sense of accomplishment for being able to give back to the community, since many students find it difficult to access past papers. I further developed a website which can be accessed from any web browser on any device. I initially created this website for the Vodacom CodeLikeAGirl competition. <br>
<br>


        <span class="w3-tag w3-teal w3-round">What’s your favourite way to de-stress outside of work?</span><br> 
Apart from spending time with my friends, I watch and review movies since I consider myself a book, film and music enthusiast. I recently enrolled at the gym which has been my favourite pastime. I particularly enjoy the yoga, zumba and pilates classes as they help me de-stress. I also love skating in all forms, including roller skating, ice skating, skateboarding and rollerblading. In my spare time, I also tutor grades 10 to 12 on Information Technology.
<br>
<br>



<span class="w3-tag w3-teal w3-round">What inspires you most?</span><br> 
Something that inspires and motivates me to persevere through tough times is an ancient Greek myth of the phoenix. A phoenix is a mythical/magical bird that represents fire and passion. The phoenix bird dies in a fire, but a new phoenix rises from the ashes. In my last few years in high school, I experienced a drop in motivation and mental health, only to re-emerge this year in university, stronger than ever! Janet Fitch describes this occurrence with, "The phoenix must burn to emerge." It's truly inspiring realising that life's progression isn't linear and that you can only get stronger by persevering through difficult times.
<br>
<br> 

<span class="w3-tag w3-teal w3-round">Who is your role model and why? </span><br> 
My role model, without a doubt, is the Pakistani activist for female education, Malala Yousafzai. Being the youngest laureate, at just 17 years old, she was awarded the 2014 Nobel Peace prize. Her journey began in January 2008 when the Taliban took control and banned many things in her town, like female access to education.<br>
In 2012, she publicised her views on behalf of girls to be allowed a right to an education. As a result, the Taliban made her a target and shot her in the left side of her head. She survived and is now an Oxford university graduate and an icon for equality and female empowerment and continues her campaign through the Malala Fund.<br>
Malala keeps striving for women to have equal access to education and defies the social hierarchy that society instills against women. 

<br>
<br> 

<span class="w3-tag w3-teal w3-round">What does Women’s Month mean to you?</span><br> 
I believe celebrating Women’s Month is an integral reminder to make extra efforts to uplift myself and the women around me. We, as women, take the baton handed to us by the previous generation of women’s struggles and hand it forward to the next generation of girls to dismantle the patriarchy exponentially as we go down generations. I believe Women's Month is crucial because it highlights the progress women have made in the fight for equality while also prompting vital conversations about how far we still have to go.
<br>
In this month, we as women can amplify our diverse thinking and add the female touch to solving global problems. This month provides us with the opportunity to create awareness that we are no different in ability and knowledge, so that we are afforded the chance to showcase what we can finally bring to the table.
<br>
<br>

<span class="w3-tag w3-teal w3-round">What are the biggest barriers for South African women in general?</span><br> 
Unfortunately, growing up in a society that conditions us to perceive women as weak, fragile and inferior to males, men still have not fully accepted women being out of the home, emerging into the workforce and being equal or higher counterparts. The need to constantly have to prove ourselves to our male colleagues in the workforce, in a society that has limited support and understanding we need, adds additional strain on the struggle that women already have, whilst juggling roles as breadwinners and emotional caretakers of the family. These stereotypes put women in a box and exacerbate major issues like Gender-Based Violence. These stereotypes and barriers lead to us being paid less for the same work our male colleagues do. Men are more easily assimilated into the corporate world, where it is still obvious that men are the gatekeepers of the workplace. 
<br>
Women may not feel comfortable enough, in male-dominated spaces, to openly express insecurities without judgement or reprisal. Oftentimes, when you’re the only woman in the room, you’re afraid to express your views freely, because should you be perceived as incompetent, all women in the industry will be stereotyped as such.
<br>
<br>

<span class="w3-tag w3-teal w3-round">Do you feel empowered as a woman at Vodacom? How does Vodacom empower you and other women in the organisation?</span><br> 
Vodacom is one of the biggest reasons that I, as a woman, feel empowered today! From everything they’ve done for girls starting at school level with the program CodeLikeAGirl, which actually was the stepping stone to me being affiliated with Vodacom. With CodeLikeAGirl, we as girls know that Vodacom has the interest of future generations of women as they continue to provide opportunities for girls to empower them with skills required in the 4IR digital world we live in. We, as Gen Z, are living among the greatest technological advances and CodeLikeAGirl helps girls to be one step ahead of the game in a male-dominated industry. 
<br>
Vodacom does not just providing a bursary to pursue a career in STEM, but a platform to stand up and talk as a leader, empowering not only myself, but other girls, at just 18 years old. And this is only the beginning of my journey with Vodacom. I can only imagine how equipped and confident I will be when I formally enter the industry and take on leadership positions with confidence. There are 38 other girls all scattered across South Africa and Lesotho, that also have the privilege to have their tertiary education funded by Vodacom. Mellita Lebajoa is another epitome of how Vodacom empowers women through their internship and graduate programs – by providing vital career exploration and networking opportunities for students. 
<br>
Manini Molehe, Njabulo Mashigo, Atenkosi Ngubevana and Elegance Gozo are just some of the empowering women in Vodacom that I’ve had the privilege to meet this year! Having a panel of representative and powerful women (especially women of colour) in executive positions, such as Vodacom's, helps to encourage us younger girls who are at the cusp of our careers, to stay resilient and continue to take risks, knowing that in a company like Vodacom, progress and recognition for women is a priority. Women representatives on executive boards create a safe space for other women in the organisation to know that if they encounter challenges, there is a support network of powerful women who will help and more importantly understand and cultivate a feeling of belonging amongst all the women in Vodacom. 
<br>
<br>

<span class="w3-tag w3-teal w3-round">Do you think women have ample opportunity to take leadership roles in business and society? </span><br> 
With a changing landscape and focus on equality, there has been an increase in opportunities for women to apply for leadership positions. However, whether women are assimilated and accepted into leadership roles can be debatable. Being a leader is a lonely place. For women it is a little bit more difficult. As you go higher up the corporate ladder, there are fewer women to support each other and lean on. Also, women may have their own self-limiting beliefs as to whether they are good enough to take up these roles due to our social conditioning and fear of not being capable. We need to believe in our abilities and have the courage to take up these opportunities, to take up space and create safe spaces for other women to rise with us.
<br>
<br>

<span class="w3-tag w3-teal w3-round">What advice would you give other women in business, or those aspiring to be?</span><br> 
To fellow women out there, learn not only to extend a hand to help, but to also receive a helping hand that is extended to you. Fighting the patriarchy is difficult, but quitting should never be an option!
<br>
It is very important and necessary that we don’t hide in the shadows. It is integral that we must make ourselves seen and heard. We must speak up when we feel discriminated against or when we see it - we must not condone it. When we do speak out, we as females need to support each other so we don’t become isolated or victimised for speaking out. To all the women out there, reading this, remember that we have come this far, so chins up, we’ve got this! Let’s go out there into competitive spaces and conquer! It all starts today - with Vodacom!
<br><br>


<span class="w3-tag w3-teal w3-round">Tell me about yourself. Where were you born? Which schools did you attend? What's the one thing people don't know about you?</span><br>
        
        I was born in Pietermaritzburg, Kwa-Zulu-Natal but I’ve lived in Benoni my whole life. I attended Pioneer Primary School and thereafter Willowmoore High School. 
        Im an avid reader. Something that most people don’t know about me is that in my spare time I love watching movies and posting reviews on them from a critical perspective in relation to society, norms, beliefs, stereotypes etc.
